# Terminal

## What is the terminal and why do we use it?
- Simple answer? Speed

## Navigate folder structure
    - cd (Universal)
    - * (wildcard and Universal)
    - .
    - ..
    - / (windows)
    - ~ (Mac)
    - pwd (Mac)
    - dir (Windows)-> prints all files and folders directly inside current folder
    - ls (Mac)-> prints all files and folders directly inside current folder

## Create a folder
    - mkdir or md |Name of folder| (universal) **Can be multiple folders made at once - separated by space -> mkdir |folder1| |folder2| |folder3| etc...


## Create a file
    - type nul > |name of file| (windows)
    - touch |name of file| (Mac)

## Delete a folder
    - rmdir |name of folder| (universal) **will not work on non empty folder**
    - abbreviated rmdir -> rd (windows)
    - abbreviated rmdir -> rm (Mac)

## Delete a file
    - del |name of file| (windows) -> **File must be inside the current folder and not nested in another**
    - rm -f |name of file| (Mac)-> **File must be inside the current folder and not nested in another**


## Advanced Terminal
    - parameters -> /s or -R
    - >
    - >>


## Output
    - echo -> 
    - cat (Mac) -> prints the contents of a file in the terminal
    - type (Windows) -> prints the contents of a file in the terminal
    - type |content| > |name of file|
